# KOS Ultimate 2026 (Alpha 8) — Core System Documentation

Welcome to the central repository documentation for **KOS Ultimate 2026 (Alpha 8)**, a web-based, client-side desktop operating system simulation designed for speed, modularity, and offline capability.

This repository implements a completely decentralized, serverless architecture running entirely inside the web browser as an installable Progressive Web App (PWA).

---

## 🚀 Quick Start & Core Credentials

* **Host Environment:** Runs via any static web server (e.g., Nginx, GitHub Pages, Live Server) with no runtime build steps or backend servers.
* **System Lock Screen Credentials:**
    * **Default System Password:** `kosul`
    * *Security Note:* The password can be customized or fully removed inside the **Settings App** (`Settings` → `Password & Security`). If a custom password is set, it overrides the default and is stored locally via `localStorage`.

## 🏛️ Architectural Foundations

KOS Ultimate operates under five structural rules designed to keep the system responsive, predictable, and memory-safe:

1.  **Zero Cross-Module Direct Calls:** Components never invoke functions on other modules directly. Inter-process communication (IPC) is strictly bound to `KOSBus`, a lightweight reactive wrapper around browser custom events.
2.  **Manifest-Driven Architecture:** `kos-manifest.js` serves as the central application registry and single source of truth. The Dock, Spotlight launcher, Window Manager, and Settings read fields dynamically from this schema. Registering a new app requires zero modifications to system shells—only an addition to the manifest array.
3.  **Lazy Asset Injection:** To maintain instant initial boot velocities, application-specific scripts and styles are decoupled from the main page load. Script tags and style nodes are dynamically generated and injected into the DOM by the Window Manager (`WM`) only when the respective app is launched for the first time.
4.  **Memory-Safe Media Pipelines:** High-overhead data types (such as raw images, audio buffers, and videos) are cached exclusively as binary `ArrayBuffer` payloads inside IndexedDB. Only structural metadata remains in memory. Heavy blobs convert to DOM Object URLs dynamically and are proactively garbage-collected using an LRU cache eviction policy.
5.  **Debounced Storage Persistence:** Critical state serialization (such as active window coordinates, icon palette grids, and spotlight state) is shifted into animation loops via `requestAnimationFrame` or debounced to shield the main thread from thread-blocking disk I/O.

## ⏳ Critical Execution Order (`index.html`)

Scripts must load strictly sequentially via `defer` execution flags. Disruption of this chain causes dependency breaks across global systems:

1.  **`kos-manifest.js`**: Populates the underlying `AppManifest` array before system engines initialize.
2.  **`kos-kernel.js`**: Declares `KOSBus`, sets systemic core state flags, and configures theme configurations.
3.  **`kos-wm.js`**: Instantiates the parent Window Manager (`WM`) using definitions loaded from the manifest.
4.  *Alpha 9 Modules Insertion point (`kos-fs.js`, `kos-fs-picker.js`)*.
5.  **`apps/*`**: App packages register lifecycle execution bindings via `WM.setOnOpen(appId, callback)`.
6.  **`kos-display.js`**: Injects view engine configurations, scaling rules, and zoom factors to prevent visual styling flashes.
7.  **`kos-init.js`**: Executes the absolute final boot sequences, initializes structural DOM overlays, builds desktop elements, and restores historical active sessions.

## 🎛️ System Infrastructure Interconnects (`KOSBus`)

Cross-module coordination relies entirely on event vectors dispatched through `KOSBus`. Below is the architectural telemetry table mapping standard lifecycle transitions:

| Event Identifier | Data Context Payload | Origin Source | Active Subscribing Listeners |
|---|---|---|---|
| `kos:app-opened` | `{ appId }` | `WM.open()` | Dock UI (sync states), Task Manager |
| `kos:app-closed` | `{ appId }` | `WM.close()` | Dock UI (remove run states), Task Manager |
| `kos:app-minimized` | `{ appId }` | `WM.minimize()` | Dock UI (toggle visibility indicators) |
| `kos:app-restored` | `{ appId }` | `WM.restore()` | Dock UI (re-focus execution bounds) |
| `kos:registry-changed` | `{}` | KOS Studio | Dock UI / Spotlight (trigger layout rebuild) |
| `kos:theme-changed` | `{ theme }` | `applyTheme()` | Connected client application instances |
| `kos:glass-changed` | `{ enabled }` | `applyGlass()` | Active desktop glass panels |
| `kos:fs-write` | `{ id, type, name, size, writtenBy }` | `KOSFS.write()` | Notes App (hot-reload reactive files list) |

## 🛠️ Upcoming Alpha 9 Filesystem Strategy

The architecture lays out the migration path from isolated, single-app legacy database systems (`kos-photos`, `kos-videos`, etc.) to a centralized filesystem kernel called **KOSFS** (`kos-fs.js`).

To upgrade individual apps to support the centralized storage engine, ensure your initialization loop registers permission blocks explicitly:

```javascript
// Add this snippet inside your app module's init block to access KOSFS
const manifest = AppManifest.find(app => app.id === 'your_app_id');
KOSFS.registerApp('your_app_id', manifest.permissions);
await KOSFS.ready;

// File creation execution sample under Alpha 9 standards:
await KOSFS.write('your_app_id', textBuffer, {
  name: 'document.txt',
  mimeType: 'text/plain'
});
```

*Developer Integration Warning:* While `kos-fs.js` triggers events via `KOSBus.emit()`, Alpha 8 core modules utilize `KOSBus.dispatch()`. When executing the Alpha 9 upgrade script, register an alias binding inside `kos-kernel.js`: `KOSBus.emit = KOSBus.dispatch.bind(KOSBus);` to guarantee systemic compatibility.
